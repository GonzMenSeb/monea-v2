1. **Build Success**: `npx expo run:android` compiles and runs without errors on Android device/emulator
2. **Test Coverage**: >80% unit test coverage, all E2E tests passing (`npm test` and `npm run test:e2e`)
3. **Linting Clean**: `npm run lint` passes with zero errors or warnings
4. **SMS Parsing Accuracy**: Parser correctly identifies transactions from at least 5 major Colombian banks (Bancolombia, Davivienda, BBVA, Nequi, Daviplata) with >95% accuracy on test dataset
5. **Performance**: Transaction list renders 500+ items at 60fps, app cold start <3 seconds
6. **Documentation Complete**: All docs written with no TODO placeholders

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| SMS permission denied by user | Clear explanation UI, app works with manual entry fallback |
| Bank changes SMS format | Modular parser patterns, easy to update individual bank patterns |
| WatermelonDB learning curve | Comprehensive type definitions, well-documented repository pattern |
| Android build complexity | Use Expo dev-client, pre-configured native modules |

## Notes for Implementation

1. **Start each PR by reading `CLAUDE.md`** to ensure adherence to project standards
2. **No comments unless absolutely necessary** - code should be self-documenting
3. **Ask before assuming** - especially for bank SMS formats, verify with real examples
4. **TypeScript strict mode** - no `any` types, proper interfaces for all data structures
5. **Test as you go** - write tests alongside implementation, not after
