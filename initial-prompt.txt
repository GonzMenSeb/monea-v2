claudetm start "I want to create a React Native application specifically for android mobile devices. This application is thought to be a centrallized digital wallet. It will initially work by reading your sms messages, since a lot of colombian banks send the transaction notifications through their users sms... Following this idea, I need you to do the following: **1. Claude Setup: Help me prepare a sophisticated and well-crafted claude configuration for this project, searching for agents online, skills, and maybe plugins or things that will be useful for the project. DO NOT add too much, just think of a strategy for having the best possible claude setup for this project, following the proven proffessional techniques known to be able to optimize llm performance in these type of situations, and apply them yourself.  **2. General structure: Using the already configured and polished claude setup we methodically constructed in step 1, let's create the structure of the project. Make decisions on the best possible stack to use for the described purpose, engineer the cleanest, most sOLID, and most easily scalable structure for the project and leave a detailed description of the thought structure and it's justification documented in a special folder for documentation.(also, in this step you should search for a UI framework to work with and choose within a pool of options the cleanest, more polished, and best framework for our purposes) **3. Source Code: With the structure and the skeleton of the project being already prepared, let's program the actual source code, heavily relying in the best usage of the claude tooling and heavy machinery configured at step 1, and closely adhering to the plan described at step 2. If at any point in time, in any part of the iteration, you see yourself needing additional or more sophisticated claude settings, do not doubt and inmediately do a small parenthesis of whatever you are currently doing to solvent that lack of tools and then continue with the appropiate tools.  **4. UI Framework: use the heavy machinery built at step 1 to leverage the implementation of a very beautiful, clean and polished UI for this app. Do various iterations refining things that can be problematic or that simply DO NOT follow the best practices out there for your chosen stack. **5. Do a proffessional-tier job at documenting the project and the intended purpose, use the documenting strategy for it. **6. Make sure we have a robust and working test suite."
